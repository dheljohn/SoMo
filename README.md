# SoMo - Soil Monitoring Flutter App

A Flutter-based Android app for soil monitoring that integrates Arduino sensor data and Firebase for real-time logging, PDF export, and notifications. This project demonstrates a soil monitoring system developed as a thesis.

## Features

- 🗣️ **Text-to-speech support** for readings and UI content  
- 🌐 **Multilingual support**: Tagalog ↔ English translation  
- ⚡ **Real-time sensor data fetch** from Arduino via Firebase  
- 📄 **Export sensor data to PDF**  
- 🔔 **Local notifications** for readings  
- 📊 **History of sensor readings** with timestamps  

---

## Platform / Compatibility

- 📱 **Android only**: This app is built and tested for Android devices. iOS support is not included.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SoMo.git
cd SoMo
```

### 2. Install Flutter Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Firebase Configuration

#### Use Placeholder Configs
- The repo contains **template configs**:
  - `google-services.example.json`
  - `GoogleService-Info-example.plist`
- Replace placeholders with your **own Firebase project credentials**.

#### Create Firebase Project
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)  
2. Create a new project  
3. Enable **Realtime Database** (or Firestore)  
4. Enable **Authentication** (optional)  
5. Enable **Cloud Messaging** (optional)

#### Configure Flutter
1. Install FlutterFire CLI:
```bash
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
```
2. Configure your project:
```bash
flutterfire configure
```
3. This generates `lib/firebase_options.dart` with your credentials.

---

### 4. Arduino Setup
- Connect your soil sensors to the Arduino.
- Program the Arduino to send sensor data to **your Firebase project** (update placeholders in the Arduino code).

---

### 5. Run the App
```bash
flutter run
```

## Security Notes

- **API keys and database URLs are placeholders**; the live client database is **never exposed**.  
- Ensure your **Firebase rules** are secure if you use your own Firebase project.  
- `firebase_options.dart` and `google-services.json` / `.plist` should **not be committed with real client credentials**.
